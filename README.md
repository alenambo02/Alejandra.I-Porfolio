# Alejandra.I-Porfolio

## Description 
/*what, why, how*/
Hello! 
Welcome to a profolio I have created, displaying some of the projects I have done.
I have created this profolio to showcase some of the work I have done throughout my bootcamp course. This profolio itself displays my abilities and comfort with HTML and CSS. 

Navigation: I have included a navigation bar that will help navigate you throughout the page. 
About Me: In the about me section, you can read about myself and my current bootcamp journey.
I have included three of the projects I have created or worked on with another peer in the class. You can find his GitHub down below for further reference. Each project has a button that will depoly the project I am referencing. 
Finally, I have included a footer that will provide you with my contact information if you wish to contact me for questions, thoughts, or tips.
/*include challenges and goals*/
Challenges: Media queries, I tried to research them, watch videos but I still seem to be missing something. 

Future goals: My future goals with this project is tackle media queries within my profolio. I also plan to utilize this profolio as a starting point to my creativity behind my profolio. I hope within time you can see my development throughout my profolio display itself and also the work it displays within the page. I hope in the end to be able to better this design significantly.
